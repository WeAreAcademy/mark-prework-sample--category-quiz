    HOW TO COMPLETE THE GAME:
    - Choose a category.
    - Unscramble the jumbled word and type out your guess.
    - If you get it wrong, not to worry, you can get a clue!
    - Guess all the words from each category!
    - However, be careful not to get too many wrong! 
    - NOTE: YOU ONLY HAVE 3 LIVES!ðŸ‘€
    \n
    INCREASED DIFFICULTY:
    - Difficulty increases when you transition to the next category
    - You have 3 seconds to look at the jumbled word
    - Then it will disappear and you will then be able to guess
