# Category Quiz Game

This is a quiz game with categories, written in Python by scholars Sharon and Emmanuel!

Test that you can check out this repo and run the python program contained within.

The original program source is in `src` directory. [Taken from this public repl.it](https://repl.it/@SharonAkaka1/MASTER-Academy-pre-work)

The sub-folder, `refactored`, contains the beginnings of a refactored version of this game which may be used as a starting point in translating the game to python.
